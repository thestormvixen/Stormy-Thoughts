# Stormy Thoughts

The purpose of my project is a start-up website involving the focus on Mental Health and the importance it holds on our daily lives. It can later be used as a possible advice column for those who want to submit their thoughts involving their own mental health or other issues going on in their daily lives and with possibly annonymous features. A discussion board as well for submissions.
